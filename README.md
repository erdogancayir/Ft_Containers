# Ft_Containers
The aim of this project is to understand how the containers of the STL, some interesting allocation method, some tricks with the linker and optimisation.
In this project, I re-implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library. I have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated ones) is expected.
